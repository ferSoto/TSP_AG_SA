# TSP_AG_SA
TSP solved using genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

My very first try solving TSP using evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithm) and its performance comparative with another metaheuristic (Simulated annealing).

Genetic algorithm:
  -Tournament selection (it would be changed for Ranking selection).
  -PMX Crossover
  -Mutation for un repeated integers.
  -Replacement using a new generation, not in the current generation.
