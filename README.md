# TSP solved by Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing

This is my very first try of solving the **Travel Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a *Genetic algorithm (GA)*. For this case, the GA was compared in performance with another metaheuristic, the *Simulated Annealing (SA)*. 

The GA uses the next operators:
* Tournament selection (it will be changed for Ranking selection).
* PMX Crossover
* Mutation for unrepeated integers.
* Replacement using a new generation, not in the current generation.

The SA is the simple one, with no modifications.
